# Predictive-Modeling
# Customer Churn Prediction
Project Overview
This project predicts customer churn using a machine learning model. The dataset contains information about customer demographics, services used, and billing information. The goal is to develop a predictive model that identifies customers who are likely to churn.

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Scikit-learn
NumPy
# Dataset: (https://github.com/chandrabhanyadav/Predictive-Modeling/blob/main/customer_data.csv)
The dataset contains customer data from a telecom company. 
Features include demographic details (e.g., age, gender),
services subscribed (e.g., internet service, phone service), and 
billing information (e.g., monthly charges, total charges). The target variable is Churn, which indicates whether a customer has left the service.

Key Features in the Dataset
gender: Male/Female
SeniorCitizen: Whether the customer is a senior citizen
Tenure: Number of months the customer has stayed with the company
MonthlyCharges: The amount charged monthly
TotalCharges: Total amount charged
Churn: Whether the customer churned (Yes/No). 

Model Performance
Accuracy: 79%
Precision: High for non-churn, moderate for churn.
Recall: High for non-churn, moderate for churn.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates a basic predictive model for customer churn, useful for telecom companies to develop retention strategies for at-risk customers.
